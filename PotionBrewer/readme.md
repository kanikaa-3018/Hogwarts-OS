## 🧠 AI Integration (Agent.ai)

The Potion Brewing App Installer integrates **Agent.ai** to bring magic-level intelligence to the user experience.

### 🪄 How Agent.ai Enhances the App

1. **Smart App Recommendations**  
   Agent.ai analyzes your installed potions (apps) and intelligently recommends others that match your interests or needs.

2. **Natural Language Spell Commands**  
   Use simple magical phrases like `"Accio VLC"` or `"Expelliarmus LibreOffice"` to install or uninstall apps using Agent.ai’s natural language processing.

3. **Memory-Based Contextual Awareness**  
   Agent.ai stores past interactions and adapts its suggestions accordingly — improving with each use.

4. **Voice Activation (Coming Soon)**  
   Speak your spell commands aloud to install apps hands-free via Agent.ai’s voice capability (WIP).

---

### ⚙️ Setting Up Agent.ai

1. Create a free account at [Agent.ai](https://agent.ai)
2. Obtain your `API Key` and `Agent ID`.
3. Add the following to a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
AGENT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AGENT_ID=your_agent_id_here
```
4. Ensure your internet connection is active.
5. Agent.ai integration is automatic and invoked when:
   - Searching apps
   - Requesting suggestions
   - Unlocking magical content
   - Using spell commands

**🧪 Example: API Call with Agent.ai**
```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.agent.ai/invoke-agent", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.AGENT_API_KEY}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    agent_id: process.env.AGENT_ID,
    input: "Suggest a photo editor",
    memory: [
      { role: "user", content: "I installed GIMP" },
      { role: "assistant", content: "You might also like Krita or Inkscape" }
    ]
  }),
});
```
The returned suggestions are rendered in the magical recommendations pane within the app UI.

## 🔒 Privacy & Performance
- All communication with Agent.ai is encrypted.
- No sensitive data is shared — only context relevant to recommendations.
- You can toggle Agent.ai features in settings.
- Agent.ai processes are optimized for minimal performance impact.
