# 🧙‍♂️ Hogwarts OS – A Magical Linux-Based Operating System

Welcome to **Hogwarts OS**, a fully immersive and wizardry-themed operating system built on top of Linux Mint Cinnamon 21.3. Inspired by the world of **Harry Potter**, this project reimagines the computing experience with a unique blend of **custom themes, spell-based terminal commands, AI-powered tools, gamification, and interactive visuals**.

Developed as part of the **Hackanovate Hackathon** at **ABES Institute**, Hogwarts OS is designed to combine fun, functionality, and fantasy for all magic and tech enthusiasts.

- 🧠 Embedding **AI-powered tools** for intuitive interactions.
- 🧪 Introducing **gamification, XP, and unlockables** to make computing enjoyable and rewarding.
- 💻 Offering both **a full OS experience** and **installable modules**, making it versatile for all users.
